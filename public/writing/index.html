        They come from the same place as my design thinking, but move at a
        different pace. I’m drawn to writing traditions that approach meaning
        differently—Persian philosophy, Irish poetry, and both Western and
        Eastern ways of shaping thought through language. Some writing leans
        into metaphor and patience, letting meaning unfold. Other traditions
        favor structure, clarity, and consequence. What holds my attention lives
        between those approaches—where feeling and discipline coexist, and where
        language is used to reveal rather than persuade. Each piece here stands
        on its own and is presented as originally published.
