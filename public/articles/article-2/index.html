        <p>
          I was 10 years old when I left Iran in 1985. The revolution of 1979
          had turned the country upside down, and the war that followed brought
          devastation to my doorstep. Air raid sirens, the sound of bombs, and
          the constant uncertainty of survival were the backdrop of my
          childhood. My parents, like many others, made the difficult decision
          to leave everything behind and start over in the United States—a
          choice that meant safety but also profound loss. Arriving in America
          felt like stepping into a completely different reality. I had escaped
          the chaos of war, but now I faced a different kind of challenge:
          learning how to belong in a culture that felt foreign and, in some
          ways, indifferent. My classmates worried about things I couldn’t
          relate to—what to wear, what to watch on TV. For me, life had always
          been about survival, not trivial choices.
        </p>

        <p>
          At first, I thought I was the one who had to adapt completely, to mold
          myself into this new world. And I did—I learned the language, excelled
          in school, and built a life filled with success. But as I grew older,
          I started to see the limitations of the world around me. It wasn’t
          just cultural differences or the pain of being misunderstood. It was
          something deeper: a lack of self-reflection in the people and systems
          I encountered. The Missing Depth in Today’s Society.
        </p>
        <p>
          The U.S. has always prided itself on being a melting pot, a place
          where people from all over the world can contribute to a collective
          culture. And yet, the way the country approaches education, community,
          and even mental health often lacks the depth required to truly
          understand those contributions. <p>Take education, for example. Schools
          here teach basic facts about history and culture, but they rarely go
          beyond surface-level lessons. Students might learn that Persia, now
          Iran, was the birthplace of one of the world’s greatest empires, but
          they don’t learn about the profound contributions that Iranian culture
          has made to humanity. They don’t learn that Iranians developed some of
          the first systems of governance, pioneered fields like mathematics and
          medicine, and contributed timeless works of art and literature.
          <p>Iranian history is a testament to cultural intelligence—an ability 
            to think critically, innovate, and adapt that has been passed down 
            through generations. These are the qualities migrants bring with them, 
            often unrecognized and undervalued.</p>

        <h2 id="problem">The Problem of Shallow Thinking</h2>
        <p>
          What frustrates me most is the lack of self-reflection I encounter in
          so many people. Growing up in the U.S., many people are insulated from
          the complexities of the world. Their understanding of life is shaped
          by stability and security, things I could never take for granted. Too
          often, I’ve seen people rely on quick judgments and labels, reducing
          the complexity of a person’s identity to something that needs to be
          “fixed” or dismissed.
