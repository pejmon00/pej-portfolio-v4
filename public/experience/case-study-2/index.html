        <h2 id="context">Overview</h2>
        <p>
          As Amazon moved to build its own operating system, window management
          became a critical layer of the stack. The challenge was enabling
          multiple applications and system surfaces to coexist—stacked,
          side-by-side, or overlaid—while remaining predictable, performant, and
          visually coherent.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Problem -->
      <section aria-labelledby="problem">
        <h2 id="problem">Role</h2>
        <p>
          Lead designer for the window management model. Defined system-level
          rules for layout, focus, and hierarchy. Partnered with platform and
          application engineering teams. Established contracts enabling
          coordination across processes.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Approach -->
      <section aria-labelledby="approach">
        <h2 id="approach">System / Work</h2>
        <p>
          The work focused on creating a governed windowing framework at a high
          level of the OS—one that could coordinate applications that did not
          have direct visibility into each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Key aspects included directional communication between layers, z-order
          and priority rules, support for glassmorphic background treatments,
          and a responsive grid system enabling multiple applications to run
          concurrently across screen configurations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because processes were isolated, the system relied on clear contracts
          and signals rather than shared state, allowing complex layouts without
          breaking encapsulation or performance guarantees.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Design -->
      <section aria-labelledby="design">
        <h2 id="design">Outcome</h2>
        <p>
          Enabled predictable multi-window experiences at the OS level. Allowed
          advanced visual treatments without compromising stability. Made
          concurrent applications viable through clear spatial and behavioral
          rules. Provided a durable foundation for scalable, responsive layouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once concurrency and spatial rules were established at the system
          level, the focus shifted to how information could surface globally
          without breaking application boundaries.
