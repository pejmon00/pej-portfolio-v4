        <p>
          This case study traces the evolution of my design systems
          practice—from early asset abstraction to fully tokenized
          systems—showing how foundational system thinking enabled scalability,
          theming, and behavioral consistency across products, platforms, and
          organizations.

        <h2 id="problem">Role</h2>
        <p>
          Design systems lead and contributor across multiple organizations.
          Defined system abstractions, contracts, and governance. Partnered
          closely with engineering to align design intent with implementation.
          Mentored designers and guided system adoption and evolution.

        <h2 id="approach">System / Work</h2>
        <p>
          The work began at Roku, where supporting dozens of OEM partners
          required the system to handle frequent icon swaps and theming changes
          driven by manufacturer deals. XML-based abstraction was introduced to
          separate assets from implementation, enabling replacement without
          rewriting the system, though tooling limitations made theming and
          library management difficult to maintain.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Google, the emergence of Sketch enabled a tighter bridge between
          design and engineering. Vector-based assets defined in JSON allowed
          shared SVG libraries and live specs, reducing translation loss and
          enabling a common source of truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Amazon, the work matured into a robust tokenized design system,
          particularly for automotive platforms. Tokens were structured around
          base and semantic layers, allowing typography, color, layout, and
          theming to adapt through rules rather than manual updates. This
          approach enabled system-level capabilities such as restriction
          management based on rules and conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This work continues through mentorship and leadership at 42,
          supporting designers and teams in applying tokenized systems thinking
          to new platforms and use cases.
        </p>

      <!-- Design -->
      <section aria-labelledby="design">
        <h2 id="design">Outcome</h2>
        <p>
          Enabled scalable theming and OEM customization without fragmenting
          systems. Reduced design–engineering friction through shared
          abstractions. Established token-driven rules supporting adaptive
          layouts and behavior. Laid the foundation for higher-level systems
          such as global UI surfaces and embedded AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a shared design language in place, the next challenge became
          orchestration—how multiple surfaces and applications coexist without
          conflict.
